Scale down slightly to fit in xc7k160t!

1x 10G uplink
24x 1G SGMII (DP83867, three 8 port line cards)

4x4 crossbar

Consider potential of 2x VSC8512 based line cards in the future, ideally on the same FPGA board

Should we use the FFG676 package instead of FBG484?? What IO banks to use?

FBG484
One part in inventory
4x GTX
185x HR
100x HP

FFG676
Two parts in inventory
8x GTX
250x HR
150x HP

Need two banks for the SGMII. Can theoretically use HR, but this is risky as we've done DP83867 bringup on HP only
48/50 of each bank used for the SGMII itself
One blocked by the calibration (IOSERDES loopback for clock phase alignment)
One free pin, should probably not use for routability reasons

Max packet rate: 24x 1 Gbps + 1x 10 Gbps = 34 Gbps

36 bit wide QDR-II+ needs:
* 36x D write
* 36x Q read
* 1x WPS
* 4x BWS
* 18x A
* RPS
* QVLD
* 2x K/K#
* 2x CQ/CQ#
= Total 101 pins, so 2 banks plus one extra pin in another bank?

Can definitely fit the QDR in the HR banks on a FBG484 packaged FPGA if we use the HP for the SGMII

QDR-II+ max data rates for FBG484:
* HP = 500 MHz
* HR = 400 MHz

For FFG676:
* HP: 500 MHz
* HR: 450 MHz

QDR-II+ is 2.5 cycle read latency
Simultaneous read and write on separate ports, burst length 4
addresses single rate alternate clock cycles

Max rate for streaming in fifo mode (i.e. 50/50 mix of linear reads and writes):
* 400 MHz: 28.8 Gbps
* 450 MHz: 32.4 Gbps
* 500 MHz: 36.0 Gbps

Only 550 MHz (FFG676 HP) is able to handle full throughput including the 10G interface

All combinations can comfortably handle the 1G ports. This should be fine, since we don't need much buffering on the 10G

Consider dual QDRs for FFG676 case??
Dual needs 202 pins, will fit in 250x HR comfortably
Provides 64.8 Gbps of buffer bandwidth
May enable a second 10G uplink if sufficient logic capacity is available, TBD...
