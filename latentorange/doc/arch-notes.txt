New proposal: 24x SGMII, 8x 10G SFP+, 2x 40G QSFP+
Dual channel QDR-IV XP
	CY7C4142KV13
	144 Mbit, 4M x 36 bits
	800 MHz = 1600 MT/s
Block RAM based buffering for QSFP+ ports, use QDR for SGMII and SFP+ ports

Max packet throughput
	* 2 Mpps per 1G link
	* 20 Mpps per 10G link
	* 80 Mpps per 40G link

	Total 2x 40G, 8x 10G, 24x 1G = 368 Mpps (1 lookup per 2.7 ns)

	Existing implementation of address table is 64x 2KB blocks @ 156.25 MHz
	4K rows, 4 way set associative, 72 bits per entry.
	1 lookup per clock, pipelined
	We need to more than double this!

Switch fabric link selection
	Driven by exit ports
	Every clock, if not already forwarding a packet...
		Each port has a bitmask indicating whether it wants to send to us
		If our bit is set, read the packet into our queue

		How to handle multi/broadcast? (for now treat as the same?)
		Global barrier sync is the easiest option but will potentially hurt performance
			Set RTS to all ports that have broadcasts pending
			Wait until they finish forwarding and assert CTS
			Then push the packet
